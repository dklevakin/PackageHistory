It contains one folder named as \"packageshistory\" which contains .aspx page with name as PackageHistory.aspx.\r\n3. You can copy this folder and paste it in your Webroot\\Sitecore\\admin folder. [Just a note : you can deploy it on any directory you wish to. But better to put under admin folder as it is secure folder, and as this page is using Single file model. It won't restart/recycle your application.].\r\n4. Access your page using  http://<YOURHOSTNAME>/sitecore/admin/packageshistory/packagehistory.aspx\r\n5. That's it! Enjoy! :-)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Option 2\r\n1. Download Sitecore Package, Which will copy the files at required place from here.\r\n2.
